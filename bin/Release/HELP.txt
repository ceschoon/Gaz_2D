Introduction:

Gaz_2D is a program that simulates a gas by computing 2D elastic collisions between particles (blue disks) in a 2-dimentional box. It shows a real-time distribution of the particles velocities.

IMPORTANT:

TO BE USABLE, THE EXECUTABLE HAS TO STAY WITHIN THE SAME FOLDER THAT WHICH OF THE DLLs.

Usage:

1. Open a command prompt and go the the location of this file (by typing "cd <path>")

2. Run the command "Gaz_2D.exe" to execute the program

3. You can set some parametres by addings arguments after the command. 

E.g:  "Gaz_2D.exe --number=20 --noDistribution" 
will call the program such as the number of particles to 20 and no window for the velocities distribution will appear.

4. Typing "Gaz_2D.exe --help" will show a list of all the possible parameters that can be used.
